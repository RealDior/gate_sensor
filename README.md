# gate_sensor_v1
Hey! This is a script made for Flight Simulators!! 
Once an aircraft has reached the end of a gate, the gate sensor will enable and give pilots the ability to set their parking brake!

How To Install? 
1) Download  the files 
2) Drag the "gate_sensor-1" folder into your server resource folder 
3) Open your server.cfg file
4) Add this line: "start gate_sensor-1"

How To Add Gates? 
1) Open the client.lua file with a code editor (Notpad++, Visual Studio Code, ext) 
2) On the top of the file there will be a list of coordinates. Input the coordinates in the format stated at the top of the file. Format: {{x, y, z, heading}}
3) Save the file and restart the resource 

Notes: 
When adding coordinates, make sure to put the coordinates of the end of the gate.
I have set the coordinates at the last 3 lines on the LSIA gate lines.
